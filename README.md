# **🔌 VIRTUAL CHECK**
**Virtual Check is a Python script permiting you to check if the user is running your program in an Oracle virtual machine.**<br>
**I made it because I nedeed it, and all methods people shared on forums is not working at all, please leave a star.**<br>
```
# You have to put the code in virtual-check.py here, or importing it as module works as well.
if virtual_check():
    print("This computer is running in a virtual machine.")
else:
    print("This computer is not running in a virtual machine")
